#The working of the project would be as follows :car: :taxi:
> 
1. Customer will register/sign-in to the website by providing his information.
2. He will then be directed to the websites homepage. The home page will contain offers for car products , mechanic services ,list of mechanics and their ratings, feedback form , contact us and customer representative helpline number. If the customer wants his car to be repaired or serviced he will have to give his location and then he will be given an estimated time taken for his mechanic to reach there. He will even need to write what problem his car is facing so that the mechanic comes well prepared.
3. The customer can even give feedback about the service he got.
4. The customer can view the user ratings of the mechanic.
5. If he is facing more serious problems with the mechanic or service provided he can contact the customer representative directly through phone.
6. If any mechanic is not availaible then he will mail to admin stating that he wont be available for next few days so that he wont be shown availble and the customer would get another mechanic for his service. Subsequently he will be shown a new time estimation.
7. If any customer who does not avail the service or was not available on the location then he will be blacklisted from the site.
8. User will be able to see the "CAR" Agencies near to his location.
9. User can see the second hand car for sale.

NOTE: Agencies and second hand car information will be feeded by ADMIN. Auto upload to this services will be the future scope of the project.
