##Mission statement
The main purpose of this website is to maintain  update and provide information / service to customers through the database system for the customers facing problems with thier car in 4 easy steps. 
1) Register
2)share your location 
3)write what issues u r facing with your car

##Project Scope
###Description
 The idea for the project is to build a database for new users, registered users , offers for customer , mechanic information , area , city , car services and nearest mechanic available according to the location provided. 
  The working of the project would be as follows
  1)Customer will register/sign-in to the website by providing his information.
  2)He will then be directed to the websites homepage. The home page will contain offers for car products , mechanic services ,list of mechanics and their ratings, feedback form ,  contact us and customer representative helpline number.
  If the customer wants his car to be repaired or serviced he will have to give his location and then he will be given an estimated time taken for his mechanic to reach there. He will even need to write what problem his car is facing so that the mechanic comes well prepared.
  3)The customer can even give feedback about the service he got
  4)the customer can view the user ratings of the mechanic.
  5)If he is facing more serious problems with the mechanic or service provided he can contact the customer representative directly through phone.
  6)If any mechanic is not availaible then he will mail to admin stating that he wont be available for next few days so that he wont be shown availble and the customer would get another mechanic for his service. Subsequently he will be shown a new time estimation 
  7)If any customer who does not avail the service or was not available on the location then he will be blacklisted from the site.
##Goals
  the goal of the organization is to maximize the base of customer database using the service and to provide good services 
by limiting the customers to go to a mechanic personally in case of a car brekadown
